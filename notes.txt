SDL_GetError() - returns the SDL error string

SDL_WM_SetCaption() - sets the title of the window

SDL_Delay() - waits number of millisecs

SDL_Quit() - exits SDL system and frees the window memory

SDL_Surface - represents the app window or an image
SDL_SetVideoMode() - creates the window
SDL_LoadBM 	P() - creates an image surface from a bmp file
SDL_BlitSurface() - draws a source rectangle from source surface to destination rectangle on destination surface
SDL_DisplayFormat() - copies a surface to a new surface with proper pixel format and color. makes blitting faster. is this needed?
SDL_Flip() - actually draws the image to the screen
SDL_FreeSurface() - frees the memory of a surface

SDL_Rect - represents a rectangle
SDL_FillRect() - fills a rectangle with a color

SDL_Event - represents an event. contains the type of the event as a field
SDL_PollEvent() - sticks an event from the SDL event queue to the given event struct

Uint32 - type that contains color data
SDL_MapRGB() - gets an image pixel format and color values, and returns a Uint32 color
SDL_SetColorKey() - gets a surface and a Uint32 color, and sets the color key of the image (used for making transparent background when blitting)
